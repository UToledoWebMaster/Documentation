# Instructions

1. Copy the HTML from the text file into the source code of your page.
2. Replace the placeholder URL in the src attribute with the embed-style URL of the video you want to embed.

Note: This code assumes that the video being embedded is of 16:9 aspect ratio. That is almost always the case. If it is not the case for a particular video, the padding-top property of the fullWidthVideo class will need to be overridden with a value that matches the source aspect ratio.
