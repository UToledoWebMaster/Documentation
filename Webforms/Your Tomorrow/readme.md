# Instructions

These forms belong in the Admission "Department" in Webforms.

Due to the unique (but consistent) stylization of the forms on the Your Tomorrow site's landing pages, I recommend making a copy of a recent landing page form in Webforms and editing it if necessary, rather than making a new form from scratch.

"Your Tomorrow - Health Professions Campaign 2020" is a good source to copy from.
