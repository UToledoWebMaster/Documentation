# Webforms

## Steps to implementing a webform

1. Create a form on https://webforms.utoledo.edu/
2. Be sure to "Shrink" every piece of the form.
4. Copy the CSS code from this folder into the custom CSS area found in Setup & Embed > Preferences > Form Styles > Inject Custom CSS
5. If you want a one-column form, delete the clearly marked section of code at the bottom of the CSS. If you want a two-column form, drag a Form Collapse item from the Survey Tools menu to where you want the form to break into a second column.


## Known Issues

- Fonts: Jubilat does not work inside the iframe. This is why we use Source Sans Pro for the submit button.
